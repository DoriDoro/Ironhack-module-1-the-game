      <p>
        You see a picture of an known animal on the right side. You can see the
        German name including the title and also the English name of this animal
        in the left littel box. <br />
        <br />
        The task is to learn how to write the name including the title of this
        animal in German during 10 seconds <br />
        and remember it. <br />
        <br />
        After the 10 seconds you have to write the name of the animal in German
        in the textfield below the picture and submit your answer. <br />
        <br />
        For the special characters in German you find them in the little box
        next to the timer. <br />
        <br />
        On the first page of the game you will find an easy example.
        <br />
        <br />
        Good luck!
