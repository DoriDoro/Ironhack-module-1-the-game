      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        You see pictures of known animals on the right side of the page. 
        You will see the German name including the title of this animal and 
        the English name too in little boxes. <br />
        <br />
        The task is to learn how to write <b>the German name including the title</b>
        of the displayed animals during 10 seconds and remember it. <br />
        <br />
        After 10 seconds you have to write the German name of the animal 
        in the textfield below the German name box. For this task you have
        30 seconds of time. <br />
        <br />
        For the special characters in German you find them in the little box under 
        the testfield where you write down your answer. <br />
        <br />
        On the first page of the game you will find an easy example.
        <br />
        <br />
        Good luck!
