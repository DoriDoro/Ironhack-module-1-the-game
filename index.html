        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          You will see pictures of known animals on the right side of the page. 
          In little boxes you will see the German name including the title of this animal and 
          the English name too. <br />
          <br />
          The task is to learn how to write <b>the German name including the title</b>
          of the displayed animals during 10 seconds and remember it. <br />
          <br />
          After 10 seconds you have to write the German name of the animal 
          in the textfield below the German name box. For this task you have
          15 seconds of time. <br />
          <br />
          The special characters in German language you find them in the little box under 
          the textfield where you write down your answer. <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          Good luck!
